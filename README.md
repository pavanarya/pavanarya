### 

**https://www.wageverify.com**

WAGEverify was built with the employee in mind while being the perfect verification solution for employers and verifiers

**1. DataPipeline for ingesting data into Elastic Search from different payroll Sources and processing**

Employee Payroll data is the backbone for this application. We recieve payroll data from almost 10+ sources and out of that Payroll feed

from Paychex(, Inc. is an American provider of human resource, payroll, and benefits outsourcing services for small- to medium-sized

businesses. With headquarters in Rochester, New York, the company has more than 100 offices serving approximately 670,000 payroll
clients in the U.S. and Europe). So with these many data sources in place, it will be a big task to handle them efficiently. So We usually read

different formats of payroll data and finally convert that into MongoDB and at the same time ingest individual employee pay records into

Kafka and finally process that data and insert it into Elastic Search. On the otherhand we allow verifiers to register in our application and

they can search for employees and purchase their reports.

**2. Continuous Build and Continuous Integration ( CI & CD)**

I was using Jenkins and few plugins provided by community for continuous integrationa nd continuous deployments of one of our products
at Sails. The main idea behind this was to deploy code and execute unit test cases with a single click. As a part of this project, I wrote

Jenkins scripts, MS Build scripts and also scripts for interacting with AWS from command line interface.

**3. Building Lambda In AWS**

One of our clients were in a need to execute some code in the background. There are quite a few of them and I suggested them to go with

Server less architecture. For this we choose AWS Lambda's and we implemented them using Asp.Net Core.

**4. Making use of AWS Capabilites in our Product**

There are many AWS features which we were using frequently in our day to day implementations.Few of them are

i. Aws Lambdas
ii. AWS Cloud Instances

iii. VPC for securing and isolating our environment from external.

iV. SES ( Simple Email Services) - For Inbound and Outbound Mail communications from our applications

V. S3 buckets - For storage purposes

**Work Opportunity Tax Credit**

The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) is a federal program that provides tax incentives to employers for hiring and retaining individuals
from targeted groups. To claim the credit, an employer must identify a potential hire as being eligible for one of the target groups, on or

before the day of the job offer. The credit is open to any tax paying company in the 50 United States, The US Virgin Islands, and Puerto

Rico. This is another component where we use processed payroll records and also using certain questionnaire and certain criteria, we

decide whether an employee is eligible for certain tax credits.

 These are my personal blogs where I write about technologies and challenges that I face during my day to day activities.
Xyzcoder.githhub.io was built with 0 cost and maintainance by using Github Pages and a static website generator Jekyll which
internally uses Ruby and Rails.
I also use Firebase as database that supports my blog for dynamic content. For front end I am using Bootstrap.

# 3. BLUETRACKMEDIA (NOV 2016-MARCH 2018)

 I was part of a team who were trying to redefine the AdTech Industry with innovation and technology.
Having 7+ years of experience in Microsoft technologies (.Net), I was given an oppurtunity to work on technologies like PHP,Java
and many cutting edge technologies like Docker,Redis,ReactJs
I was able to deliver some crutial projects by making use of above mentioned technologies.

# 4. MYCAREER.COM (JAN 2015-DEC 2016)

 This is the inhouse product which we built at Sails Software Solutions. Intially it was a tough personnel decision to start working
on this product with an awsome team of 4 members leaving behind all my comforts as a developer at Big MNC's, But the results
are fruitful. I am sure I would have regretted for a life time if I didnt join this company. Durging this period, I got a chance to work
on many open source technologies like Python, Node.js,ReactJs,Apache Spark.

## Some Interesting Projects which we executed at Sails:

**1. MyCareer.com:**

MyCareer is conceptualized, built, invested-in and founded by a couple of Human Capital Management industry veterans with backgrounds

in Business and Engineering. Our sole mission is to provide a tool to recruiters that they can call "Recruiters Best Friend", by bringing in Big
Data and Analytics tools to the science and art of recruiting. We brought many Big Data tools into picture like Apache Spark, Hdfs, Elastic

Search to crunch our huge resume database and extract data that can be easily consumed by recruiters. Along with that we implemented

many fancy functionalities which makes day to day job of a recruiter easy.

For building the web application we were using technologies like CoucheBase(NoSQL Database) for storing non transactional data.
Node.Js for building API's which can be consumed by ReactJs which we used to build Single Page Applications(SPA)

**2. Extracting Related Skills:**

The main motto behind this project is to show related skills for a given skill. For example, If I enter C# then I am supposed to get related

technology skill name in Microsoft stack like Asp.Net,Mvc, WebApi,Sharepoint,Html and others. We had a huge database of 7+ Millions

resumes in word and pdf format. So this is all in raw format and I need to convert them into valid text format. For this purpose, I was using a

cluster of Apache Spark of 10 machines and converted these doc format resumes to hdfs file system. Later I scrapped skills dataset from
Linkedin and other data sources. Now using Apache Spark, I started tagging text resumes with skills we extracted. Also we used Natural

language processing(NLP) for POS Tagging. Once this is all successfully done, we started applying our algorithms to group related

technologies from this huge dataset of 7 million resumes.

**3. Making Our Search Faster:**

Our resume database was growing drastically and it is our responsibility to provide end users a seem less experience for data retrieval. So

the team implemented Elastic Search and indexed our 7+ Million resumes and we were able to retrieve data fastly.

**4. Recruiter Friendly Chrome Extension to Extract User Profiles:**

The primary motto behind this extension is to help recruiters in saving their candidate data into a centralized location ( MyCareer.com). On
a daily basis a recruiter visits many sources like LinkedIn, Naukari, Dice , Monster and many other job sites for finding potential candidates.

Some of these sites charge based on Per user view and another drawback is they need to either download thses resumes and store them

at random places and there are plenty of chances in loosing this data. So when a recruiter makes use of our Extension and create a free

account with MyCareer.com, they can simply browse these potentials candidates on these job sites and iin the background we sync
candidates data into MyCareer.com Now recruiter can login into MyCareer and can take appropriate actions on these candidates and can

create a workflow.

**4. Revolving IP Implementation**

One of the main pain points with resumes is they become stale once a candidate finds his dream job. So the pain point that we had is, we

always wanted to have fresh candidate data and a source for fresh candidate data is sometimes their social media profiles. So we built a

sytem which can query linkedin and other social media applications with candidate data we had, like Firstname, lastname, email and
retrieve his updated data. But the problem here is some of these social media sites throttle number of calls we make. So In order to

overcome that problem, we built a custom python script. We get a list of Proxy IP's available( for example https://free-proxy-list.net/) and

then using each of these proxy IP's we make a call to some of these social media sites. Once an IP reaches its limit, we use next IP which

we got from Free Proxy List.
